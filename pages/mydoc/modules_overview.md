On these pages, you'll find a variety of ENEXA modules listed below, showcasing the diverse functionalities the platform has to offer.

## Transform module

The ENEXA RDF Transformation module is a straightforward tool designed for transforming RDF data. It takes one or more RDF files as input and generates a single RDF file as output. This module is particularly useful for consolidating RDF data from multiple sources into a unified format.

#### Goal

The primary objective of this module is to merge RDF datasets into a single RDF file while ensuring compatibility with Apache Jena-supported RDF serializations. Key considerations for input files include:

- **Supported RDF Serialization:** Input files must utilize an RDF serialization supported by Apache Jena.
- **Compression:** Input files can be compressed with GZIP or BZip2 for efficient data storage and transmission.
- **Metadata Graph:** Input files should include mime type information in the metadata graph. If absent, the module will infer the RDF serialization based on the file extension.

The output file:

- Contains all triples from the input RDF datasets without deduplication.
- Adheres to the specified RDF serialization, supporting streamable formats such as Turtle, N-Triples, N-Quads, and TriG.
